# iCode
iCode is a complex heavyweight unreliable iOS IDE for Linux.

## How do I run it ?
iCode requires `mono-runtime`, `gtk-sharp3`, `libgdl-3-5` and `clang`. 

These packages can be installed with APT using this command:

`sudo apt install mono-runtime gtk-sharp3 libgdl-3-5 clang`

## What can I do with iCode ?
Nothing, for now. We have a private roadmap, and a legacy version that contains some of the code needed to build iOS apps.

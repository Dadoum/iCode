/*!
 *  @class      MPSMatrixSoftMax
 *
 *  @dependency This depends on Metal.framework.
 *
 *  @abstract   A softmax kernel that operates on matrices.
 *
 *  @discussion A MPSMatrixSoftMax object computes:
 *
 *                  B_ij = Exp { A_ij } / ( Sum_k Exp { A_ik } )
 *
 *              A and B are matrices which are represented by MPSMatrix
 *              objects. This filter computes the same result for MPSMatrices as
 *              MPSCNNSoftMax filter does for MPSImages by interpreting the columns
 *              of the matrix as feature channels, that is the sum runs over column indices.

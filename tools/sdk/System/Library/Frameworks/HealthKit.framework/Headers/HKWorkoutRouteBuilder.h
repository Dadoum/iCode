                Calling finishRouteWithWorkout:metadata: will stop and complete the route. If the builder is deleted,
                or the client goes away before calling the finish method, data will be lost.

 @discussion    Call this method when the route has been completed. The completion handler will return the saved
                HKWorkoutRoute. If no series data was added, then workoutRoute will be nil and an error returned. The
                receiver will be considered invalid afterwards and any further calls to it will result in an error.
 
 @param workout    The HKWorkout object to which the route will be associated. Must be saved to HealthKit
 @param metadata   Optional metadata may be added to associate with the series. Predefined keys are found in
                   HKMetadata.h, or private NSString keys used by the client are allowed. Acceptable metadata value
                   types are NSString, NSDate, NSNumber and HKQuantity
 @param completion The completion callback handler returns the saved HKWorkoutRoute object. If workoutRoute is nil, an

                   device lock. Subsequent requests for the HKWorkoutRoute can be made through HKSampleQuery or similar
